### About Me
I'm a software developer in my final year at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. I am strongly interested in building full-stack applications, automating workflows, and working in cloud environments.

* **Studying:** Bachelor's in Information Technology Engineering (estimated graduation 2025).

* **Location:** Turku, Finland  
* **Languages:** Finnish (native), English (fluent)  
* **Interests:** Software Engineering, Full Stack web-development CI/CD, IaC, Cloud/AWS<br> 


### Tech I have used
* **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript  
* **Backend:** Node.js, PostgreSQL
* **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Terraform, Linux, Git, CI/CD  
* **Testing:** Unit, Integration, E2E and (GitHub Actions)
* **Others:** HTML, CSS, Figma, Adobe Photoshop<br>

### I'm Working on

#### **Coding App**
A full-stack TypeScript application designed as a LeetCode-style code editor where users can create and solve coding challenges. The app will feature CI/CD pipelines and support multi-environment deployments to AWS.

* Currently in the setup phase: configuring servers, databases, and building CI/CD pipelines while managing infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform for AWS deployment. *No features available yet*.
#### **Thesis topic exploring**
Currently exploring potential topics for my thesis, I have a few broad ideas:
* Scalable Network Architecture with Native Node.js: Exploring Buffers, Streams and Concurrent Processing
* Enhancing Deployment Efficiency through Infrastructure as Code (IaC): A Scalable Solution for Multi-Environment Management with Terraform on AWS
* Building a Test Automation Framework for Reliable E2E Testing in Production-Ready Full Stack Applications
