- **Languages:** Finnish (native), English (fluent)  
- **Studying:** Bachelor's in Information Technology Engineering (graduating 2025)  
- **Interests:** Software Engineering, Full Stack web-development CI/CD, IaC, Cloud/AWS<br> 



### Tech I have used
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript

### I'm Working on

#### **Coding App**
A full-stack TypeScript application designed as a LeetCode-style code editor where users can create and solve coding challenges. The app will feature CI/CD pipelines and support multi-environment deployments to AWS.

- Currently in the setup phase: configuring servers, databases, and building CI/CD pipelines while managing infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform for AWS deployment. **No features available yet**.
#### **Thesis topic exploring**
Currently exploring potential topics for my thesis, few broad ideas:
- Scalable Network Architecture with Native Node.js: Exploring Buffers, Streams and Concurrent Processing
- Enhancing Deployment Efficiency through Infrastructure as Code (IaC): A Scalable Solution for Multi-Environment Management with Terraform on AWS
- Building a Test Automation Framework for Reliable E2E Testing in Production-Ready Full Stack Applications 

## Projects
