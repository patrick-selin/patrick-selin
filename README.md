### I'm Working on
#### **CRM App**
A full-stack TypeScript application: basic CRM app. The app will feature CI/CD pipelines and support multi-environment deployments to AWS.
* **Current Status**: In the setup phase—configuring servers, databases and building CI/CD pipelines. Managing infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform for AWS deployment.
* **[Check the project repo](https://github.com/patrick-selin/crm-app)** for more details and documentation.

#### **Thesis topic exploring**
Currently exploring potential topics for my thesis, I have a few broad ideas:
* **Scalable Network Architecture with Native Node.js**: Exploring Buffers, Streams and Concurrent Processing
* **Enhancing Deployment Efficiency through Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: A Scalable Solution for Multi-Environment Management with Terraform on AWS
* **Building a Test Automation Framework for Reliable E2E Testing** in Production-Ready Full Stack Applications
