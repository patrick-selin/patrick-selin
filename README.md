I'm a software developer in my final year at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. I am strongly interested in building full-stack applications, automating workflows, and working in cloud environments.


### About Me

- **Studying:** Bachelor's in Information Technology Engineering (estimated graduation 2025)

- **Location:** Turku, Finland  
- **Languages:** Finnish (native), English (fluent)  
- **Interests:** Software Engineering, Full Stack web-development CI/CD, IaC, Cloud/AWS<br> 



### Tech I have used
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Terraform, Linux, Git, CI/CD  
- **Testing:** Unit, Integration, E2E and (GitHub Actions)
- **Others:** HTML:, CSS, Figma, Adobe Photoshop<br>


### I'm Working on

#### **Coding App**
A full-stack TypeScript application designed as a LeetCode-style code editor where users can create and solve coding challenges. The app will feature CI/CD pipelines and support multi-environment deployments to AWS.

- Currently in the setup phase: configuring servers, databases, and building CI/CD pipelines while managing infrastructure as code (IaC) with Terraform for AWS deployment. **No features available yet**.
#### **Thesis topic exploring**
Currently exploring potential topics for my thesis, I have a few broad ideas:
- Scalable Network Architecture with Native Node.js: Exploring Buffers, Streams and Concurrent Processing
- Enhancing Deployment Efficiency through Infrastructure as Code (IaC): A Scalable Solution for Multi-Environment Management with Terraform on AWS
- Building a Test Automation Framework for Reliable E2E Testing in Production-Ready Full Stack Applications 

## Projects
#### **Web applications**
